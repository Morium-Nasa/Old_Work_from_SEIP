    <p><pre>I am my parents' affectionate daughter.<pre>
I grow up with everyone's love,

There are many dreams in my imaginations,

I want to be educated!

I am my parents' affectionate daughter.

If the life spends inside four walls forever,

I will only be a burden then. &nbsp

Education will surely give me freedom! &nbsp

I am the hope for tomorrow,

I also have wishes and wills,

Don't keep me locked in a home!

Take me ahead!  &nbsp

I am my parents' affectionate daughter!  &nbsp </p>
