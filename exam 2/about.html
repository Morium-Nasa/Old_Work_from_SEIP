        <h1>Villege Environment</h1>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">An environment is the natural surroundings which help life to grow, nourish and destroy on this planet called earth. Natural environment plays a great role in the existence of life on earth and it helps human beings, animals and other living things to grow and develop naturally.
        But due to some bad and selfish activities of human beings, our environment is getting affected. It is the most important topic that everyone must know how to protect our environment to keep it safe forever as well as ensure nature’s balance on this planet to continue the existence of life.

        People living in the villages mostly indulge in agricultural activities and stay away from the hustle and bustle of the chaotic city life. They lead a simple life. A day in the life of a villager starts early morning. People usually wake up around 5 am and start with their daily chores. Since most of the people in the villages sleep on their roofs they are woken up as the day light breaks. They may even be woken up by the crowing of rooster.</p>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">In most of the villages, it is the male members who go out to work while the females sit at home and complete the household tasks such as cleaning and cooking. Children get ready and head to the schools located nearby. The male members are mostly involved in farming and other agricultural activities. They either have their own farms or work for the landlords who hire them. Cycles are the most common means to travel from home to work. This is the reason why the pollution level in the villages is far low compared to the cities.

        Farmers toil hard in the farms. Many of them go home for lunch others have their lunch in the shade of a tree. All in all, life in a village is slow yet peaceful.</p>

      <h3>Villege Life <span style="font-size: 14px; color: #abaaac;">Images</span></h3><hr>
      <p style="color:  #004b00; text-align: justify;">Village life is quite slow but peaceful. Villagers lead a simple life. They live in harmony with each other. They value relationships and make efforts to maintain the same. They are well aware about the people living in their neighborhood and stand by them in their hour of need.Villagers also give special importance to their customs and traditions and follow them religiously. The festivals in villages are celebrated collectively and thus the joy and happiness during that time doubles up.

      People in villages are mostly involved in agricultural activities. Some of them are artisans and are involved in preparing various kinds of beautiful handicraft items.

      Villagers may not be equipped with modern day technologies and gadgets but they have their own ways of enjoying life.

      Many of the villages around the world are devoid of the basic amenities such as electricity, sanitation facilities, hospitals, schools, etc. Villagers face numerous challenges owing to the lack of these amenities. Most of the villagers do not give much importance to education. They are content with the basic education they acquire in the village schools. </p>

They value and respect each other. They visit one another quite often and celebrate all the occasions together. This is good for the growth and development of the children as well as a plus for the elderly people who are often isolated in the cities.</p></div>
